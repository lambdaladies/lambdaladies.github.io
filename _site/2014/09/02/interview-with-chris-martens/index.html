<h3>Who are you and what do you do?</h3>

<p>I&#39;m <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ecmartens/">Chris Martens</a>, or chrisamaphone everywhere on the internet, and for the last ~6 years i&#39;ve been a computer science grad student at CMU!</p>

<h3>Tell us about what you&#39;re studying.</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been studying in the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/pop/pop.html">POP (Principles of Programming)</a> group. We&#39;re all working on programming languages in some capacity, usually with a types/logic angle. I&#39;ve done a couple of projects on dependent types and proof assistants, and now I&#39;m working on a logic programming language for my thesis.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s logic programming?</h3>

<p>Logic programming is a way of interpreting a collection of logical assertions as a program! In the wild you might encounter Prolog or (more practically) database systems like SQL -- the concept of a &quot;query&quot; comes from the idea of asking a question in logic, &quot;is the formula A provable,&quot; and then having your program execute as a search for a proof of A (there might be multiple proofs.) At its core, a logic program interpreter is &quot;just&quot; a theorem prover.</p>

<h3>What kind of problems would you say logic programming languages are well suited for?</h3>

<p>I&#39;d say any time you&#39;re thinking primarily about the <em>relationships</em> between data, logic programming might be a good fit. I think their most common use is in databases, but that&#39;s actually the one I&#39;m least familiar with. I&#39;ve used logic programming most as a tool for expressing formal systems -- things like languages and logics that you can describe naturally through inference rules. </p>

<h3>Systems like...say, games?</h3>

<p>Heh. Yes! I was trying to figure out a good segue to that...my thesis project started with noticing that logic programs might be a good way to represent the rules of games. Games aren&#39;t always thought of as formal systems, and some argue that doing so can impede design. But on the other hand, I like to think of a formal description as something that sits nicely at the boundary between human and computer. As a human, you can think more in terms of game rules instead of &quot;how exactly am I going to represent all these data structures and get good performance&quot;, but you still have something you can execute &amp; play with.</p>

<h3>Is your thesis language specifically related to games?</h3>

<p>Yep! I started out trying to make it really broad and talk about &quot;interactive systems&quot; in general, but having a really specific application has helped me make a lot more progress...especially an application that I care about independently from PL stuff, and one that a lot of people can relate to and talk about.</p>

<h3>Tell us a little bit about the language itself and in what ways games/interactive systems have shaped it.</h3>

<p>The language I&#39;m starting with is one that I got super into after my advisor Frank Pfenning, who coauthored the language, taught a class that used it. It&#39;s called Celf, and it still lives in a tiny little academic corner with zero documentation, but you can find it <a href="https://github.com/clf/celf">on GitHub</a>. My language will basically be talking Celf, skimming off a simple subset of the language, and adding capacity for interactive execution, along with some special mechanisms for control flow between program components. My design has also been inspired by <a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a>, a popular engine for making text games. It&#39;s basically a logic programming language already... but as I&#39;ve used it I&#39;ve been more convinced I need to make a language based on Celf!</p>

<h3>OK, so at this point I have questions about PL design and also about games...walk north for PL design, and open the door for games?</h3>

<p>&gt; open door</p>

<h3>Tell us about a game you&#39;ve made!</h3>

<p>So, I mostly make interactive fiction (IF), except my IF is weird because I don&#39;t really like writing fiction -- I tend to just make these weird little systems that happen to get rendered in text. But recently I&#39;ve been into a 2D games engine called <a href="http://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE2D</a>, which I used to make a game called &quot;QWOP training run&quot;
and it kind of has the structure of IF, in that i&#39;m telling a branching story (autobiographical) through it, but it&#39;s superficially just an arcade-like running game (you mash keys to run faster.) The branching points in the story are represented by geographical branching points in the running route. You can <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1HJXoh3BOUbU21LcWZiWGVyZ0E&amp;usp=drive_web">check it out yourself</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you a gamer? What draws you to game design?</h3>

<p>I dunno if I&#39;m a gamer. I feel like there&#39;s a lot of gatekeeping around that term, so I prefer to stay away from it. But I really enjoy what people who approach games as an artform can manage to do with it. It&#39;s a form of expression where your audience participates in the experience, so you can use that to tell stories, or to communicate systems, including social ones. A lot of what I like about games is the same as what I like about math. It&#39;s stuff you express in rules, and the rules <em>do</em> things - they contain this world that (if designed well) will keep surprising you.</p>

<h3>Do you have a strong math background?</h3>

<p>No and yes. I don&#39;t have a lot of what I think of as &quot;standard math&quot; -- calculus, real analysis, linear algebra... but I&#39;ve learned a lot of algebra and category theory over the last few years, which is pretty fun. I was lucky enough to be at CMU where Steve Awodey was teaching category theory, sort of at the forefront of a new wave of mathematical foundations, a few years before the Haskell community exploded and everyone was talking about it.</p>

<h3>Speaking of! Do you consider yourself part of any computing &quot;communities&quot;?</h3>

<p>Community is tricky for me (maybe just as tricky as for everyone). It seems like academics are expected to find community w/their collaborators &amp; colleagues, but it never felt easy for me to fit into that. And a lot of non-academic groups tend to focus on one specific language, which also doesn&#39;t feel right to me. So that leaves online communities, and I guess the sort of ad-hoc computing communities that form on <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisamaphone">Twitter</a> are the ones I feel most active on. People say Twitter is no good for discussion, but I&#39;ve had some pretty constructive academic &amp; programming discussions on there.</p>

<h3>Thoughts/feelings about academia vs games programming you do?</h3>

<p>Academic CS and the kinds of games communities I follow seem like they&#39;re about as far apart on the &quot;tech&quot; spectrum as they can get. Within games communities, &quot;academia&quot; often refers to humanities or arts programs -- or maybe this is just my IF predisposition, &#39;cause a lot of those folks come from &quot;electronic literature.&quot; And when they think of computer science&#39;s relevance to games it&#39;s usually &quot;AI,&quot; for various values of things under that umbrella (conversation bots, NLP, social modeling) rather than programming languages (PL). I&#39;m hoping my research will take me in directions -- either by doing more academia or getting hired by more experimental games companies -- that can bridge the ideas. I think PL, functional programming, etc. have a lot to offer digital arts &amp; computational creativity, because we think a lot about <em>interfaces</em> to expression. The cultures are just so different. I wanna help that change!</p>
