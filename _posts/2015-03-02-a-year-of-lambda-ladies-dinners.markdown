It's always fun to attend a conference and run into a number of Lambda Ladies. That has happened to me several times over the past year.

- Clojure/West - In March 2014, [Clojure/West](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZdCLR02grLp__wRg5OTavVj4wefg69hM) was held in San Francisco. A few Lambda Ladies came by and new friends were recruited. Kelsey organized an impromptu dinner where even more local Bay Area Lambda Ladies joined. [Cognitect](http://cognitect.com/) was kind enough to sponsor dinner for us. We had a full house at dinner, and then many of us stopped by the conference party afterward.

- OSCON - There were a number of Lambda Ladies speaking at [OSCON 2014](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014) in Portland, OR, so we decided to hold a dinner. Thanks to [PuppetLabs](https://puppetlabs.com/) for sponsoring this time. Several of us swung by the conference party at the PuppetLabs offices after dinner.

- Strange Loop - There were so many Lambda Ladies speaking, more attending, and many new friends introduced to Lambda Ladies at [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com/) in St Louis in September 2014. So many, in fact, that we threw a party instead of a dinner. We went bowling! [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/) was our sponsor for this great event.

- Clojure/Conj - In November 2014, Lambda Ladies and new friends [had dinner](http://annapawlicka.com/my-first-conj/) at the [Clojure/Conj](http://clojure-conj.org/), sponsored by my employer, [LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com). [Brick Alloy](http://brickalloy.com/) sponsored, also, as it regularly does. Afterward, we all walked over to the Crime Museum for the conference party.

Conversation at Lambda Ladies dinners is always interesting. Between all of these dinners, I learnt about: life at Hacker School, who is using functional programming for what at work, the history of Prolog, and eigenharps. Lambda Ladies have a wide variety of interests, to say the least. I was able to learn more about speakers' topics, and, in some cases, help calm nerves for those still writing their slide presentation software ahead of their talks.

I hope to see more Lambda Ladies at events in 2015!
